This folder contains all data generated in the major and minor simulation studies.
Each .mat file contains two matrices: T (true unrescaled parameter coefficients in order a2, a1, a0, b2, b1, b0, h2, h1, h0)
and F (1000 sets of fitted unrescaled parameter coefficients in order a2, a1, a0, b2, b1, b0, h2, h1, h0),
fitted to log-transformed (log) and untransformed (nonlog)
ingestion (IR) and clearance (CR) rates,
sequentially (seq) and simultaneously (sim)
with four scenarios of temperature dependence of the Hill exponent b:
constant (const), exponentially increasing (exp), hump-shaped (hump) and U-shaped (U),
and in case of the minor simulation study with linearly (lin) and logarithmically (log) spaced prey densities.
